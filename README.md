# dang-pelican-barebones

## What is it? 

This repository contains a barebones D3 + Angular + Pelican deployment.

Check it out, and you can get started right away creating a Pelican site that uses 
Angular.js.

## Where is everything?

The ```pelican``` directory contains all the important files. This consists primarily
of a barebones Pelican theme that includes Angular (and other goodies), 
but is packed as a whole ready-to-go repository since that is more the style I like.

The theme is called simple-angular, and it is a really stripped-down version
(most of the non-essential blog stuff like tag/category/author pages is ripped out).
The template is intended for use developing static pages.

## How to use it?

Check out a copy of this repository to get your site going.
You can start by modifying the theme to give your site a style,
then add some pages, templates, angular webapps, and you're on your way.
